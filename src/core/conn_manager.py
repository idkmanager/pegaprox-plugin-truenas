"""One WebSocket connection per configured TrueNAS instance, lazy-connect,
multi-instance from day one (per brief §2/§3 — TrueCommand-style).

Mirrors the "connection manager" pattern used by other PegaProx plugins
(e.g. the Proxmox-power plugin's node manager): a thin registry keyed by
instance id, handing out (and lazily creating) one ``TrueNASWSClient`` per
instance, with ``is_connected`` / ``connection_error`` accessors so routes
can report instance health without forcing a connect.

        Reusing a cached-by-id client here would mean: instance already
        connected to host A, operator edits the Settings form to host B
        (same id) and hits "Probar conexión" -> the cached client for that
        id is already connected to A, so ``connect()`` is a no-op and the
        login round-trips against A while the route reports success for a
        B that was never actually contacted. Always closed in ``finally``
        so a test connection never leaks a live socket into the process.

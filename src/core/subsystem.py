"""``Subsystem`` contract — brief §2's synthesis of the CloudBridge
``Provider`` interface down to what a single-vendor, multi-instance plugin
actually needs: a uniform ``list/read/health`` shape per TrueNAS concept
(pools, datasets, snapshots, shares, replication, apps_vms, system), with
``write`` read-only by default until F2 wires real writers behind the
dry-run/confirm/audit pattern (brief §5).

Concrete subsystem modules under ``src/subsystems/`` each define a class
implementing this contract PLUS a couple of subsystem-specific helper
functions (e.g. pools' ``temperatures()``) that don't fit the generic
shape — the contract standardizes what routes/tests can rely on across
every subsystem, it doesn't try to cram everything into three methods.

Attrs passthrough (brief §2): responses from the TrueNAS middleware are
returned as-is, never normalized/flattened — the plugin doesn't invent a
lowest-common-denominator shape across subsystems.

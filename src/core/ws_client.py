"""Generic, reusable JSON-RPC 2.0 client over a persistent WebSocket, for the
TrueNAS SCALE middleware API (``wss://<host>:<port>/api/current``).

Path CONFIRMED 2026-07-20 against a real TrueNAS-25.10.1 instance, twice, in
opposite directions — the first check was wrong; the second reads the
authoritative source and corrects it:

1. First pass (WRONG): reading ``/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`` found ``/websocket``
   as a dedicated, active ``location`` block and concluded it must be the
   real JSON-RPC endpoint. This was a mistake — nginx routing tells you
   which paths reach the backend, not which *application-level protocol*
   each path speaks once it gets there.
2. Second pass (CORRECT — this is the live protocol error that caught it):
   sending a JSON-RPC envelope to ``/websocket`` against the real instance
   produced a server-side crash in ``middlewared``'s log:
   ``middlewared.apps.websocket_app.on_message(): KeyError: 'msg'`` —
   because ``/websocket`` speaks the OLD legacy DDP-style protocol (its
   first expected client message is ``{"msg": "connect", ...}``, not a raw
   JSON-RPC call). Reading ``middlewared/main.py`` directly confirms the
   real dispatch: ``app.router.add_route('GET', '/websocket',
   self.ws_handler)`` is the legacy DDP handler, while
   ``app.router.add_route('GET', f'/api/{version}', RpcWebSocketHandler(...))``
   — registered once per entry in ``self._load_apis()``, which includes the
   key ``"current"`` — is the actual JSON-RPC 2.0 handler
   (``middlewared/api/base/server/ws_handler/rpc.py``). ``/api/current`` was
   the right path from the start.

Design constraints (see PEGAPROX_PLUGIN_TRUENAS_BRIEF.md §2/§4/§9):

- REST v2.0 is deprecated in 25.10 and removed in TrueNAS 26 — this client is
  WebSocket JSON-RPC 2.0 ONLY, from F0.
- Envelope: ``{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": N, "method": ..., "params": [...]}``.
  Errors come back as ``response["error"]`` (often nested under
  ``error.data.reason``) — never normalized here (attrs passthrough).
- Auth is a *method call* after the socket is open:
  ``auth.login_with_api_key(["<key>"])``. Never retried automatically and
  never logged.
- Reconnection uses exponential backoff + jitter. A dropped socket does not
  crash anything at import time or at construction time — this module is
  lazy-connect: no network I/O happens until the first ``call()``.
- Retries are for READS only. Callers decide idempotency; this client never
  silently retries a ``call()`` that already reached the server — a timeout
  or connection error is raised to the caller, who is responsible for
  deciding whether to retry a write.

The real transport (``websocket-client``) is imported lazily inside
``_default_transport_factory`` so this module can be imported (and its pure
logic unit-tested) even in an environment where the dependency is not yet
installed — matching the "no external DNS on CT119" constraint from the
brief: importing the plugin must never explode just because a dependency
isn't vendored yet.

    Imported lazily so importing this module never requires the dependency
    to be installed (only actually connecting does).

    ``timeout`` governs only the initial TCP/TLS handshake done by
    ``create_connection``. Once open, the socket's recv timeout is cleared
    (``settimeout(None)``) — otherwise an idle-but-perfectly-healthy
    connection would throw ``WebSocketTimeoutException`` out of ``recv()``
    every ``timeout`` seconds, which the reader loop would (correctly, from
    its point of view) treat as a dropped socket: full reconnect + relogin +
    resubscribe churn, and audit-log spam against the appliance, on a
    connection that was never actually unhealthy. Per-request timeouts are
    already enforced independently by ``call()``'s ``Event.wait(timeout)``.

    ``tls_server_name``: real-world TrueNAS instances are commonly reached by
    LAN IP but present a CA-issued cert bound to a DNS name (e.g. an ACME
    cert obtained via DNS-01 for remote-access purposes), so IP-based
    hostname verification fails with "IP address mismatch" even though the
    cert is perfectly valid. Setting this overrides the SNI/verification
    name independently of ``url``'s literal host — dial the IP, verify the
    name. Confirmed live against a real instance 2026-07-20 (cert
    `CN=nas-remote.example.com`, connection host a LAN IP with no DNS relation
    to that name).

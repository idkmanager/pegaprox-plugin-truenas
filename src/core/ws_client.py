"""Generic, reusable JSON-RPC 2.0 client over a persistent WebSocket, for the
TrueNAS SCALE middleware API (``wss://<host>:<port>/websocket``).

Path verified 2026-07-20 against a real TrueNAS-25.10.1 instance by reading its
own nginx config directly (SSH): ``/websocket`` is the dedicated, active
location (``proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:6000/websocket``). ``/api/current``
also completes a WebSocket upgrade, but only because it falls through the
generic ``/api`` prefix location to the same backend — it is not a distinct
JSON-RPC endpoint and must not be relied on as "the versioned path".

Design constraints (see PEGAPROX_PLUGIN_TRUENAS_BRIEF.md §2/§4/§9):

- REST v2.0 is deprecated in 25.10 and removed in TrueNAS 26 — this client is
  WebSocket JSON-RPC 2.0 ONLY, from F0.
- Envelope: ``{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": N, "method": ..., "params": [...]}``.
  Errors come back as ``response["error"]`` (often nested under
  ``error.data.reason``) — never normalized here (attrs passthrough).
- Auth is a *method call* after the socket is open:
  ``auth.login_with_api_key(["<key>"])``. Never retried automatically and
  never logged.
- Reconnection uses exponential backoff + jitter. A dropped socket does not
  crash anything at import time or at construction time — this module is
  lazy-connect: no network I/O happens until the first ``call()``.
- Retries are for READS only. Callers decide idempotency; this client never
  silently retries a ``call()`` that already reached the server — a timeout
  or connection error is raised to the caller, who is responsible for
  deciding whether to retry a write.

The real transport (``websocket-client``) is imported lazily inside
``_default_transport_factory`` so this module can be imported (and its pure
logic unit-tested) even in an environment where the dependency is not yet
installed — matching the "no external DNS on CT119" constraint from the
brief: importing the plugin must never explode just because a dependency
isn't vendored yet.
